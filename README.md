# Dice-Generator
A browser-based random number generator that takes user input to determine a range between 1 and the specified number and then chooses a random number each time the user gives input. If the user types "quit" into the prompt window, the application will close. Otherwise the random number will be displayed in an alert, placed into an array, and the program will continue to prompt the user for the upper limit of the range.

When the user finally quits the program, the array is displayed on the web page so that all previous results can be viewed from left to right.
