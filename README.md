# Dice-Generator
A browser-based random number generator that takes user input to determine a range between 1 and the specified number and then chooses a random number each time the user gives input. If the user types "quit" into the prompt window, the application will close. Otherwise the random number will be displayed on the web page, and the program will continue to prompt the user for the upper limit of the range.
